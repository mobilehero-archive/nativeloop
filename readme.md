## Overview

`{nativeloop}` is many tools in one package:
* a command line (cli) tool for creating and working with existing {nativeloop} mobile applications
* a compile-time library for creating awesome mobile apps
* a run-time library for enhancing mobile apps
* an Appcelerator Titanium Alloy widget for augmenting Alloy mobile apps.

> **:soon: Only a few of the cli commands have been implemented at this time.
Feel free to test out the functionality that exists right now and stay tuned
as more features are added soon!**


### What is [`{nativeloop}`][]?

[`{nativeloop}`] is a framework for building awesome native apps using node.js style javascript. 
It provides developers with access to an extremely rapid development process 
without compromising on the delivered product.

[`{nativeloop}`][] is open-source (MIT) and is built upon the open-source version of [`appcelerator`][]
and other open-source products.  If you like what you see, contribute to this and other open-source projects!


## (Really) Quick Start

> Install `{nativeloop}` (if you have not already done this) and create new project!

```bash
npm install -g nativeloop
nativeloop create mycoolapp
```

## Quick Start (with some options)

### Install `{nativeloop}`

#### Option 1:  Install Globally

>This is your quickest and easiest way to get started with `{nativeloop}`.  Installing globally will 
allow it to be accessed by any our your mobile projects and give you access to the command line interface (CLI). 
If you need to use a specific version of `{nativeloop}`, use [Option 2](#option-2--install-locally) in addition to this step.

```bash
npm install -g nativeloop
```

#### Option 2:  Install Locally

>Just as quick and easy, but this will allow you to use a specific version of `{nativeloop}` for your mobile project.  Simply run this in the root of your mobile project!  In order to use the CLI commands, be sure to also [Install Globally](#option-1--install-globally)

```bash
npm install --save nativeloop
```

#### Option 3:  Install using gitTio ![coming soon!](https://img.shields.io/badge/coming-soon-orange.png)

> **:soon: Not available yet, but coming very soon!!**

>Install this as a widget using gitTio (http://gitt.io).  We hope to have this option available soon!

```bash
gittio install nativeloop
```

### Setup mobile project

#### Create new mobile project

:book: [see documentation for `create` for more details](https://github.com/nativeloop/nativeloop/blob/develop/docs/create.md)

```bash
	native create my-cool-app
```

#### Upgrade existing Appcelerator mobile project ![coming soon!](https://img.shields.io/badge/coming-soon-orange.png)

> **:soon: Not available yet, but coming very soon!!**  _(you can do this manually for now by copying the `alloy.jmk` file that is included with this package and putting it in your app.)_

```bash
	native init
```

### Install Prerequisites/Dependencies

>_Our goal is to provide as much automation as possible to make the mobile development
experience as awesome as possible.  Currently there are some prerequisites/dependencies that
need to installed manually but we hope to automate some of these in the near future!_


- [OSX] Install latest Xcode from App Store _(8.2.1 as of the time of writing)_
- Install Appcelerator Titanium and Alloy

```bash
	npm install -g alloy
	npm install -g titanium
```

- [OSX] Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh) _(optional, but highly recommended)_

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

- Install IDE of your choice _(We highly recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), 
as it is free, fast and works great with `{nativeloop}` projects!)_
- Install Android SDK and NDK

>OSX

```bash
	brew install android-sdk
	brew install android-ndk
```

>Windows

:soon: Instructions for installing on Windows coming soon!

- There might be a few more items to install... Stay tuned for more detailed instructions
